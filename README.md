# Graph_ML_node_classification

In this project, I built a GCN model that classifies nodes in the Cora dataset, using GraphSAGE and GAT layers.

For this project, we utilized the Cora dataset. Cora dataset consists of a citation network of scientific publications. Each publication (node) is connected by edges (citations) to other publications. The nodes are also labeled with classes that represent the topic of the paper.

Implemented GraphSAGE and GAT layers from scratch, using Pytorch.
